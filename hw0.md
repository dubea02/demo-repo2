<h1>I will git good</h1>

What is one benefit of using version control?
The Version Control System helps manage the source code for the software team by keeping track of all the code modifications. It also protects the source code from any unintended human error and consequences.

What is something new you learned about Git this week?
I learnt how to create new branches and commiting and pushing them into the main branch.
